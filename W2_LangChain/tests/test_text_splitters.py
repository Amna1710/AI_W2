    LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by
    language models. It provides tools for connecting models with data
    sources, creating chains, and building AI applications.

    Text splitting is an important part of document processing.
    Documents are divided into smaller chunks before being passed
    to language models. This helps manage context length and improves
    retrieval performance.

    Recursive splitting attempts to preserve meaningful text boundaries.
    Character splitting uses a selected separator. Token splitting
    divides text according to the tokenizer's token count.
